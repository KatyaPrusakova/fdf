# fdf

This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french, hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to your program.


Very good source with a lot of useful links for project:
